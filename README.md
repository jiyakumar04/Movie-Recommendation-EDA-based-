# 🎬 Movie Recommendation (EDA-based) Project  

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to explore trends in genres, ratings, revenue, and key contributors (actors, directors).  
Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we also provide recommendation insights such as **Top Movies Overall, Best by Genre, Best Recent Movies, and Director-based Best Movies**.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
